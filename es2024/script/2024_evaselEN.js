        everyone understand that avatar medicine may reduce the risks that patients need to bear during the
        treatment process, and it can overcome the limitations of distance and time. The advanced technologies
        include organoids, model organisms, big data, metaverse, etc. The general public can understand from a new
        perspective that these technologies have the potential to replace patients themselves and reduce medical
        risks. At the same time, the forum connects academic and industrial circles, so that potential technologies
        and products can be demonstrated.`
