I am a computer vision algorithm engineer in ByteDance.Inc. I'm mainly responsible for multi-modal research, as well as feature optimization and performance improvement of advertising systems.

I received the master degree from Peking University, China under the supervsion of Prof. [Yadong Mu](http://www.muyadong.com). And I'm majored in computer vision and deep learning during that time. My research work mainly involves in Cross modal retrieval, Deep Hashing, Medical AI, Steganography, and Image Captioning.

Before that, I received my bachelor's degree in computer science from the School of Computer Science in Wuhan University, Wuhan China.
