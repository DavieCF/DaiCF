## Selfie to Anime Based on Image Translation

- Completed an application that can transfer the human in a selfie into animation style and change the background at the same time. It mainly includes three modules: Human Matting, Face style translation and Background neural style transfer. It can synthesized the fine-grained animation human face into the style transferred background image to get a cartoonization photo.

## ORB-SLAM2 Based Android AR Application

- Ported the ORB-SLAM2 framework to Android platform, and developed an APP which can localization the phone and construct environment map simultaneously based on pure vision. And implemented an AR APP combined with OpenGL, which can be used indoors and outdoors. Stable localization and display of virtual objects can be achieved in a variety of complex environments. Achieved 10 fps performance on a Mi 6 mobile phone with a Snapdragon 835 ARM processor.

## Mobile-side digital watermarking information security system

- Designed and developed a digital watermarking-based security system. While users are using a specific APP to take pictures, additional information can be hidden in the photo through the digital watermarking technology and then sent to server. The background server can parse and extract the information contained therein. This system can be used in many fields such as current asset surveillance, enterprise sign-in, anti-piracy and investigation.
