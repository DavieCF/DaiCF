I have developed a strong research potential in innovative physical layer security solutions for future wireless technologies with ultra-low energy requirements but high security standards. My research aims to bridge the gap between the theoretical modelling and practical exploitation of physical layer security using state-of-the-art testbeds and equipment.

In particular, my research endeavors to ensure the secure connection using key generation and device authentication using radio frequency fingerprint identification.
